## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

NodeJS should be installed on your machine.

### How to run

1. Clone the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/software-engineering-2023/Code-PROs.git
```

2. Move to the website's directory.

```sh
cd Code-PROs/Online-Bank-Website
```

3. Install live-server (It is needed to run on a server because Chrome prevent CORS ON file scheme).

```sh
npm install -g live-server
```

4. Run a local server to view project. (for some reason port 3000 works fine but not the default 8080)

```sh
 live-server --port=3000
```
